<p>Currently, the only authentication scheme available to use with Riak CS is the S3 authentication scheme. A signature is calculated using several elements from each request and the user's <em>key_id</em> and <em>key_secret</em>. This signature is included in the <em>Authorization</em>&nbsp;header of the request. Once a request is received by the server, the server also calculates the signature for the request and compares the result with the signature presented in then <em>Authorization</em>&nbsp;header. If they match then the request is authenticated; otherwise, the authentication fails. Full details on the S3 authentication scheme are available <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>If 'auth_bypass' is set to true in app.config, the system ignores the Signature portion of the authorization header described below:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">Authorization: AWS <em class="replaceable"><code>AWSAccessKeyId</code></em>:<em class="replaceable"><code>Signature</code></em></pre>
