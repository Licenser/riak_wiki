            Reduce phases</td>

        <td>Indexes for terms are replicated to N vnodes (i.e. term-based 
            partitioning) and stored in a merge index backend, regardless of the 
            Riak KV backend used</td>
        <td>Indexes are located on the same vnodes as the object (i.e. 
            document-based partitioning) and stored in the LevelDB backend along 
            with the document</td>

            Standard, Integer, and No-Op) or a Custom Analyzer</td>

            application is responsible for tokenization</td>

        <td>N/A</td>
        <td>No anti-entropy features. If a search partition is lost, the entire
            search index needs to be rebuilt</td>
        <td>Anti-entropy is carried over from KV; if a partition is lost,
            secondary indexes will be rebuilt along side the KV data by read 
            repair</td>

    <tr>
        <td><em>Limitations</em></td>
        <td>MapReduce operations are performed in memory and must be completed 
            within the timeout period</td>
        <td>Querying low cardinality terms could tax a small subset of vnodes; 
            composite queries are expensive; documents must be structured (JSON 
            or XML) or plain text</td>

        <td><em>Poor Use Cases</em></td>
        <td>Performing complex operations on large numbers of objects (e.g. analyzing every object in a bucket)</td>
        <td>Searching for common (low cardinality) terms in documents</td>
        <td>Searching prosaic text</td>
