# Comparing MapReduce, RiakSearch, and Secondary Indexes

Riak supports a variety of data retrieval methods in addition to basic GET
operations. Each of these methods provide different abilities and tradeoffs. As
such, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of each, so 
you can pick the right tool for the job.

## MapReduce

[[MapReduce]] is used to perform ad-hoc queries and transformations on known
sets of keys. While full bucket MapReduce is supported, it's expensive and 
should be used sparingly in production environments. It should be noted that
[[Link-walking|Links#Link-walking]] is powered by MapReduce.

## Riak Search

[[Riak Search]] enables structured documents to be indexed and queried by a 
SOLR-like syntax. This means that a rich query syntax is available for free-text 
queries. Riak Search is primarily meant as a way to index prosaic data along 
with its relevant metadata.

## Secondary Indexes

[[Secondary Indexes]] are a new feature of Riak 1.0 that allow users to create 
indexes by adding metadata to Riak objects. A common use case would be the 
retrieval of objects by tag. With Secondary Indexes, it's relatively simple to 
model one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. For example, a blog post could 
be tagged with all of its categories, and be then retrieved by any of those 
categories.
