Bugs happen. We do our best to find them all but will inevitably miss some. Here's the protocol to follow for when you think you might have found something that needs reporting.

h2. Before You File a Bug or Issue

Before you file a bug or issue, we ask that you put in the necessary time and research to ensure that what you are reporting is in fact a bonafide bug and not the result of some other configuration, operating system or application problem. To ensure your bug report is worth filing, please attempt do the following:

# Search through the existing issues for the code in question on the relevant GitHub repo. Basho uses GitHub for the development of "all of our code":https://github.com/basho/. 
# Search the "Riak Mailing List Archives":http://riak.markmail.org/ for similar issues and possible resolution paths. (The Mailman archives of the list archives can also be accessed "here.":http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/)
# Email the "Riak Mailing List":http://lists.basho.com/mailman/listinfo/riak-users_lists.basho.com with your issue to see if there is a simple path to resolution. 

h2. Writing and Filing Your Bug Report

<div class="info">
	You'll need a GitHub account to file an issue. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a free account "here":https://github.com/signup/free. 
</div>	

# Select the "appropriate GitHub repo":https://github.com/basho/ for your bug. There is a lot of code that makes up Riak, so be sure to try and select the correct repository. For example, if Riak is failing to build due to some specific environment variable, this should be filed against the "Riak repo":https://github.com/basho/riak/issues; if Riak's Search API is failing for a given query, this is an issue with the "riak_search code":https://github.com/basho/riak_search/issues.
# Compose and submit your issue, providing as much detail as possible. Strive to be concise, precise, and clear. Include version numbers, relevant code snippets, steps to reproduce, etc. 

*If at any point you have a question about how to file a bug or think there is something fishy about this process, please use the "Riak Mailing List.":http://lists.basho.com/mailman/listinfo/riak-users_lists.basho.com*
