Riak should be installed from source if you are building on a platform for which a package does not exist or you are interested in contributing to Riak.

## Dependencies
Riak requires [[Erlang|http://www.erlang.org/]] R14B03 or later. If you do not have Erlang already installed, see [[Installing Erlang]]. Don't worry, it's easy!

<div class='note'>Riak will not compile with Clang. Please make sure your default C/C++ compiler is GCC.</div>

## Installation
The following instructions generate a complete, self-contained build of Riak in `$RIAK/rel/riak` where “`$RIAK`” is the location of the unpacked or cloned source.
